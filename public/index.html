<!---Cannon is quite obselete-->

    - No documentantion found. Link in the github repo to doc. not available anymore '404'
    - The same situation above applies to NPM 
    - Due to the lack information and documentation regarding its implementation I decided to clone this code
    - Something I'd like to highlight is the implementation and readability of this code
    - Since it's using React, I think this a good example on how Three.js or Babylon could be implemented in React.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
